"""
MCP Server for Feature Management
==================================

Provides tools to manage features in the autonomous coding system.

Tools:
- feature_get_stats: Get progress statistics
- feature_get_by_id: Get a specific feature by ID
- feature_get_summary: Get minimal feature info (id, name, status, deps)
- feature_mark_passing: Mark a feature as passing
- feature_mark_failing: Mark a feature as failing (regression detected)
- feature_skip: Skip a feature (move to end of queue)
- feature_mark_in_progress: Mark a feature as in-progress
- feature_claim_and_get: Atomically claim and get feature details
- feature_clear_in_progress: Clear in-progress status
- feature_create_bulk: Create multiple features at once
- feature_create: Create a single feature
- feature_add_dependency: Add a dependency between features
- feature_remove_dependency: Remove a dependency
- feature_get_ready: Get features ready to implement
- feature_get_blocked: Get features blocked by dependencies (with limit)
- feature_get_graph: Get the dependency graph

Note: Feature selection (which feature to work on) is handled by the
orchestrator, not by agents. Agents receive pre-assigned feature IDs.
