/**
 * XalaBaaS Shared Features - Convex API Types
 *
 * Re-exports the generated Convex API for type-safe function references.
 * This allows feature hooks to use proper Convex React hooks with typed functions.
 *
 * NOTE: This is a source-only package. The relative path resolves at each
 * app's compile time via Vite.
