- Pricing groups and rules
- Amenity groups and individual amenities
- Addons with different pricing models
- Sample bookings in various states
- Season definitions and applications

### Test Utilities

**MockContext:**
- Provides mocked database operations
- Simulates Convex function context
- Includes in-memory data store for state verification

**TestDataStore:**
- Manages test data lifecycle
- Provides seed methods for all entities
- Handles relationships between entities
- Supports data reset between tests

## Test Scenarios

### Happy Path Tests

1. **Resource Discovery → Booking → Confirmation**
   - User searches and finds resource
   - Checks availability for desired time
   - Selects time slot and configures addons
   - Completes booking and receives confirmation

2. **Season Management → Application → Allocation**
   - Admin creates and publishes season
   - User submits application
   - Admin reviews and approves
   - System creates allocation

3. **Organization Setup → User Invitation → Activation**
   - Admin creates organization structure
   - Invites users with specific roles
   - Users accept invitations
   - Users gain appropriate permissions

### Edge Cases

1. **Concurrent Bookings**
   - Two users attempt to book same slot
   - System prevents double booking
   - First user succeeds, second gets error

2. **Season Deadline**
   - User tries to apply after deadline
   - System rejects application
   - Clear error message provided

3. **Permission Boundaries**
   - User attempts admin operations
   - System blocks unauthorized actions
   - Audit trail records attempt

4. **Resource Limits**
   - Booking exceeds capacity
   - System validates and rejects
   - User informed of constraints

### Error Handling

1. **Validation Errors**
   - Missing required fields
   - Invalid data formats
   - Constraint violations

2. **Business Logic Errors**
   - Duplicate resource slugs
   - Circular organization references
   - Invalid time ranges

3. **System Errors**
   - Database connection issues
   - External service failures
   - Timeout scenarios

---

## Performance Testing

### Load Testing Scenarios

- Database query performance
- Memory usage patterns
- Error rates by function
